8. How many loops in JavaScript, and how do they work?



In JavaScript, there are seven types of loops that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on specific conditions or to iterate over objects and iterable collections.

For Loop: This loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. It contains initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line.
While Loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
Do-While Loop: Similar to a while loop, but the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition.
For-In Loop: Used to loop through the properties of an object.
For-Of Loop: Used to loop through the values of an iterable object, such as an array.
forEach Loop: A method on arrays that executes a function for each element in the array.
Map Loop: A method on arrays that creates a new array by executing a function on each element in the array.
Each loop type is suited for different scenarios, allowing for efficient and concise code when dealing with repetitive tasks or iterating over collections.

but we mostly use only 3 
for loop 
while loop
do while loop 
 other are not in use as much as these are
